A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ...
Luke Skywalker was on the planet Tatooine and two droids found him. He met Obi Wan Kanobi and they went with
Han Solo to locate where the signal the droid had was coming from. They went to the death star and met the princess
and they escaped. They then went to a rebel base but the empire tracked them. The death star came to blow them up
but they blew it up first.
